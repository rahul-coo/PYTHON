# Flask Launching Page ðŸš€

This is a simple Flask application that serves as a **launching (landing) page**.  
In this video, we begin the Flask Framework series. We will understand what Flask is, why it is used, and its key components. Flask is primarily used to develop end-to-end web applications. We will discuss its features and explore practical applications and projects throughout the series.

If you are planning to become a data scientist or are already working as a machine learning engineer, you often work with various machine learning applications and create your own models. For example, if you are working with generative AI or language models, at the end of the day, you need to showcase these models in action. To do this, you must create an end-to-end web application. For instance, you might create a form that takes input, interacts with your ML model, and returns a response from that model. Flask is the framework that enables you to build such applications.

If you want to create an end-to-end web application, Flask is a crucial framework to learn. In this series, we will cover all these aspects in detail. Let's start by understanding what Flask framework exactly is.
